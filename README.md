# UNP_PROJECT_BI_WITH_MS_EXCEL_CUSTOMER_CREDIT_CARD_DATA    
I worked on a project named UNP_PROJECT_BI_WITH_MS_EXCEL_CUSTOMER_CREDIT_CARD_DATA with my friends. We analyzed customer credit card data using Microsoft Excel to uncover valuable business insights. I created key performance indicators (KPIs) to evaluate customer behaviors, such as spending trends and repayment patterns. We utilized pivot tables to dynamically organize and summarize the data for deeper insights. Pivot charts were created to visually represent trends and anomalies effectively. This project demonstrated the power of Excel as a business intelligence (BI) tool for analyzing structured data. The collaboration with my friends helped me enhance my skills in data analysis, visualization, and teamwork.
